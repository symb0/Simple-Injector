Simple injector which uses the standard LoadLibrary injection method with the ability to bypass csgo's LoadLibrary prevention.

In order to compile, you need to have at least a C++17 compiler. If you have an older version of the compiler, then instead of using structured binding declaration to return multiple values, use std::tie or std::get.
